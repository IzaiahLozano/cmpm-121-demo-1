This is the starter code project for the `Demo 1` project in CMPM 121, Game Development Patterns, at UC Santa Cruz (fall quarter, 2024). Students should incrementally modify this project, tracking their progress with git, to develop an incremental game of their own unique design.
This is my first commit for this first demo of the first quarter of my last year...God willing.
